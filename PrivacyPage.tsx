          <p><strong>Note on User Content:</strong> When you upload an image to our service, that image is sent directly to Google's Gemini API for processing. We do not log, store, or otherwise retain your images on our servers after the processing is complete. The process is stateless. The text content generated from your image is also handled in a stateless manner. It is returned to you in your browser session and is not stored in our systems.</p>
          <p><strong>Misuse Disclaimer:</strong> Users are strictly prohibited from uploading or processing any illegal or sensitive documents such as identification cards, passports, credit cards, or other official records.

We have configured our integration to prioritize user privacy, but we recommend you review Google's policies as well.</p>
          <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we process data in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since we do not store personal data from the images you provide, our primary role is that of a data processor acting on your instructions. The legal basis for processing this data is the fulfillment of the service you have requested from us.</p>
          
          <h3>Changes</h3>
          <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
